## What is mpv-shelf?
- Mpv Shelf is a **cross-platform folder wrapper** to organize videos you would like to keep track of.
- Compatible with **any video player out of the box** (no config required). *However*, it was created for **[mpv](https://mpv.io/)** in particular.

  ## Features
- Houses all your video/anime folders in one place.
- Keeps track of which videos you have/haven't watched.
- Renames subtitle files to match videos (WIP).
- Allows for deeply nested folder navigation.

 **mpv-shelf is made with [Tuari](https://tauri.app/about/intro) & [NextJS](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=home).**
